# Reataurant-Management-Database
This project involves the creation of a Restaurant Management Database using PostgreSQL. The database is designed to streamline various aspects of restaurant operations, including menu management, staff scheduling, customer feedback, and sales tracking. The project was inspired by real-world observations at The View restaurant, where I work. The database aims to provide a robust and efficient system for managing restaurant activities.
